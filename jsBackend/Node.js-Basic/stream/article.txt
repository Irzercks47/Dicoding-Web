Overview
Naming conventions
In the Warriors universe, the characters in the five warrior Clans (ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan, ShadowClan, and SkyClan) have names composed of two parts. Each cat's name has a prefix (Blue, Bramble, Tall, etc.) which generally stays constant throughout their life. The name's suffix varies through the character's lifespan and position within the Clan, with the bestowing of the new name being a component of the ceremonies marking these role changes. As a kitten, the character's name ends with "-kit" (Bluekit, Bramblekit, Tallkit, etc.). Upon becoming an apprentice (a warrior or medicine cat in training), "-paw" replaces "-kit" at the end of the character's name (Bluepaw, Bramblepaw, Tallpaw, etc.). When the character completes their apprenticeship and is promoted to a full warrior or medicine cat, the suffix to their name is then changed to one chosen by the Clan leader or medicine cat (Bluefur, Brambleclaw, Talltail, etc.). If a cat becomes a Clan leader, they are granted the suffix "-star" at the end of their name (Bluestar, Bramblestar, Tallstar, etc.). If a leader commits a crime, they may be deemed unworthy of their name, stripped of the "-star" suffix, and return to using their warrior name. A cat may also have their name changed in a special ceremony.

This naming convention does not hold for non-Clan characters. For example, in The Tribe of Rushing Water, a cat's name is said to be the first memorable thing their mother sees after giving birth (such as "Brook Where Small Fish Swim" or "Night of No Stars"). They are often referred to by only the first word as their name. These names remain unchanged throughout a Tribe cat's life, with one exception: if a Tribe cat becomes Teller of the Pointed Stones (a position akin to a Clan leader and medicine cat combined), their name becomes Teller of the Pointed Stones, or Stoneteller.

Cats who do not identify under any group may have entirely different names.

Spiritual beliefs
When Clan cats die, their spirits go to a place called StarClan if they were good cats in life. If the cats were not good in their life, their spirits are sent to the Dark Forest (also known as The Place of No Stars), a hellish type of purgatory. Cats may try to communicate with StarClan through a chunk of quartz deep in a mountain off the Clans' lake territory called the Moonstone, or a secluded pool of water called the Moonpool.
